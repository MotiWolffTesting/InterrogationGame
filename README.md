# InterrogationGame

A C# console-based interrogation simulation game where players investigate and interrogate different types of terrorists using various sensor technologies.

## Overview

This game simulates an interrogation scenario where players use different types of sensors to gather information about suspects and determine their terrorist classification and threat level.

## Features

### Terrorist Types
- **Foot Soldier**: Basic level operatives
- **Squad Leader**: Mid-level commanders
- **Senior Commander**: High-level tactical leaders
- **Organization Leader**: Top-tier strategic leaders

### Sensor Technologies
- **Audio Sensor**: Detects voice patterns and stress levels
- **Chemical Sensor**: Analyzes chemical traces and substances
- **Light Sensor**: Monitors visual cues and reactions
- **Magnetic Sensor**: Detects metallic objects and devices
- **Motion Sensor**: Tracks movement patterns and gestures
- **Pulse Sensor**: Monitors heart rate and physiological responses
- **Signal Sensor**: Intercepts and analyzes electronic communications
- **Thermal Sensor**: Reads body temperature and heat signatures
